# Balmung

*Java library for German morphology*


## Introduction

**Balmung** is the core of the [Asgard](https://github.com/giancosta86/Asgard) project, as it provides:

* A taxonomy of Java classes (**Lemma**, **Noun**, **NounDeclension**, **Verb**, **Adjective**) expressing *German lemmas*

* Classes modeling *morphological transforms* - for example, how a word can change from singular to plural

* *Utility classes* - for example, to deal with umlaut mutation on vowels


As a plus, all the lexicon classes are mapped with standard JPA annotations and are internally optimized to be stored to a db.



## Requirements

Java 8u144 or later is recommended to employ the library.


## Referencing the library

Balmung is available on [Hephaestus](https://bintray.com/giancosta86/Hephaestus) and can be declared as a Gradle or Maven dependency; please refer to [its dedicated page](https://bintray.com/giancosta86/Hephaestus/Balmung).
